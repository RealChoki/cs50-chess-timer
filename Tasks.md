### DONE: Store Color in localStorage
In `timecontrol.js`:
- If there's nothing in localStorage, create a new JSON and store the color.
- If there's something in localStorage, update it.

In `index.js`:
- Retrieve the color from localStorage.
- If nothing is found, use a default color ("black" or {"r": 0, "g": 0, "b": 0}).

### DONE: Add Pop-up in customtime.html for Existing Time
- Display a pop-up in `customtime.html` when the chosen time already exists.
- Ensure choosing a time in `customtime.html` is mandatory.

### DONE: Added close button for color-theme pop-up in `timecontrol.html`

### DONE: Added background color for time inputs in `customtime.html` on focus

### DONE: Finished building `editpresets.html`

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- The fields in both HTML files behave differently.
- min and max values are not functioning as expected.
- Investigate and resolve the issue.
